// Module 12.1.3: Create a Bar Chart
// https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1225/pages/12-dot-1-3-create-a-bar-chart?module_item_id=498963

// Create a [basic] Bar Chart
// (Commented out, a better bar char is below) var trace = {
// (Commented out, a better bar char is below)     x: ["burrito", "pizza", "chicken"],
// (Commented out, a better bar char is below) // (Commented out, a better bar char is below)     y: [10, 18, 5],
// (Commented out, a better bar char is below)    type: "bar"
// (Commented out, a better bar char is below)  };

// (Commented out, a better bar char is below)  Plotly.newPlot("plotArea", [trace]);

// Self-notes:
// This code for Bar Chart vs the Code for Line Graph:
//
// Line graph code:
//      Plotly.newPlot("plotArea", [{x:[1,2,3], y:[10,20,30]}])
//
// Bar Chart code:
//      (1) The data is no longer contained inside the Plotly.newPlot() method. The object that contains the x and y arrays is instead assigned to the variable "trace." This variable, trace, is the second argument of the newPlot(). Note, however, that the contents of the variable have been enclosed inside an array. 
//          The effect is still the same: an object contained inside an array.
//
//      (2) The trace object now specifies the chart as a bar chart with type: "bar".
//
//              Important: Note that it makes sense to assign the data to a variable, as it would be very unwieldy to place an 
//              entire dataset inside the Plotly.newPlot() function call. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­



// Choosing Layout Options
var trace = {
    x: ["burrito", "pizza", "chicken"],
    y: [10, 18, 5],
    type: "bar"
};

// Add a title--->The variable [layout] contains the [key] title :and the [value] "Luncheon Survey"
var layout = {
    title: "Luncheon Survey",

    // Add label for x-axis
    xaxis: {title: "Food Option"},

    // Add label for y-axis
    yaxis: {title: "Number of Respondents"}
};

// Plotly has a 3rd argument: [layout]--->refers to the [layout] object that contains the title
Plotly.newPlot("plotArea", [trace], layout);
