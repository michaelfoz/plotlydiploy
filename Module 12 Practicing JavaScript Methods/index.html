    Module 12.2.2: Practicing JavaScript Methods

    https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1225/pages/12-dot-2-2-practicing-javascript-methods?module_item_id=498978


Self-notes: 

(1) The <title> tag is appropriate to the chart Roza is creating: 
    "Fast-Growing Cities 2016â€“2017."

(2) The first <script> tag links to the Plotly CDN.

(3) The <div> tag, where the Plotly chart will be displayed, is titled "bar-plot."

(4) The second <script> tag links to the data file, data.js.

(5) The third <script> tag links to the script file for the chart, i.e., the JavaScript code.


    IMPORTANT
    Always make sure that your files are linked correctly and in the right order. 

    (1) Since Roza needs the Plotly CDN to use Plotly, 
    the CDN <script> tag should come first. 
    
    (2) Since she will also need the data to load before using Plotly, 
    the data file should be linked next. 
    
    (3) Finally, the script file is linked.

    The dataset contained in data.js:

    var cityGrowths = [
        {
            "Rank": 1,
            "City": "San Antonio ",
            "State": "Texas",
            "Increase_from_2016": "39208",
            "population": "1511946"
        },

    ...more code...

    ]


    cityGrowths is assigned to an array of objects, each
        containing a city + associated facts (e.g., population)

    This array--although contained in a separate file-- can be acced from plot.js


    [instructions at this time to create a separate plot.js file]

    Order of events: 
    1st, data.js was downloaded
    2nd, index.html (this file was created)
    3rd, plot.js will be created
