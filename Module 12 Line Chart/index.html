    Self-notes:
    
    (1) The 1st <script> tag links (CDN) to a file called plotly-latest.min.js, 
        which is downloaded from an online host. 
        This file contains the JavaScript code that makes up the Plotly library. 
        
    (2) Such a link is called a CDN.
        CDN = Content Delivery Network
        A CDN provides links to downloadable resources
            (such as Plotly library code).

    (3) <div id="plotArea"> refets to the div in which the chart will be displayed.
        (You can also give the div another id of your choice.)
    
    (4) The 2nd <script> tag refers to the file named plot.js (which contains the JavaScript code).
        
        Inside of plot.js:

            |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
            |                                                                   |
            |   Plotly.newPlot("plotArea", [{x: [1,2,3], y:[10,20,30]}]);       |
            |                                                                   |
            |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
            (This single line of code creates the chart.)
                Plotly.newPlot() is the method that creates the chart

                The method has 2 arguments:
                    (1) The 1st argument in Plotly, newPlot() is "plotArea."
                        This corresponds with the ID of the <div> tag in the HTML document.
                    
                    (2) The 2nd argument is an array (as indicated by square [] brackets).
                        Inside the array is an object (as notated in curly {} brackets).
                            Inside {}, x and y are specified.

                                (The x and y values are conatined inside arrays as well.)
    
    Example:
        Q: In VS Code, create a JavaScript file named plots.js. 
            In this file, write the code for a line chart with the following values. X: 5,10,15. Y: 10,20,30. 
            The chart will be displayed in a div named plotArea. What will your code look like?
        
        A: Plotly.newPlot(“plotArea”, [{x:[5,10,15],y:[10,20,30]}]);
            (Plotly.newPlot() creates a new chart in the plotArea div in the HTML. 
            The data is in an object, which is itself wrapped inside an array.)
