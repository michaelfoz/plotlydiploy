    Created per Module 12.3.1: Inspect an API with D3.json()

    Objective: to display a JSON formatted file in a plotly visualization.

    In order to do so, D3 (visualization library) is needed.
        The d3.json() method within the D3 library allows JSON files as well as external web APIs for data to be read.

    Practice with d3.json(): making a call to SpaceX (the aerospace manufacturer specializing in space travel)    

    Rewind: key-value pairs
    JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, is a data format that sorts and presents data in the form of key-value pairs. 
    It looks much like a Python dictionary and can be traversed through using dot notation.
