    Created per Module 12.3.2: Load a JSON file with D3.json()

    Initially, an error pops up on the console, which states
    a CORS requeste is needed.

      Instructions to remedy the error:

            What gives? What is a CORS request?

                The short explanation is that, for security reasons, a local server 
                must be run when loading an external file 
                into a JavaScript script file. 
            
                (If you don't understand these security issues right now, don't worry. 
                We will come back to it later.)

            To load the page, 
            
            (1) navigate to the directory where samples.json and index.html, 
                as well as the script file, plots.js, are located. 
            
            (2) Open the command line (Terminal or Git Bash) and type the following:
                
                    python -m http.server 

                    (You should see the following message in the command line)
                    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
                    127.0.0.1 - - [30/Oct/2019 13:23:53] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 -)

            (3) Navigate to the given port number in your browser: 
            
                    localhost:8000. 
                    
                    (localhost:8000 should appear on the address bar.)

            (4) Type code into the console to filter to parse the data:
            
                    d3.json("samples.json").then(function(data){
                        console.log(data);
                    });
            
                    --- OR ---

                    d3.json("samples.json").then(function(data){
                        firstPerson = data.metadata[0];
                        Object.entries(firstPerson).forEach(([key, value]) =>
                          {console.log(key + ': ' + value);});
                    });

            IMPORTANT
            When reading an external data file such as a CSV or JSON file into a script, you must run a server. 
            You cannot directly open index.html with your browser.

  Self-notes:


(1) Create a directory on computer and copy the file samples.json into it.
(2) Create index.html and plots.js files.
(3) Be sure to import D3.js via a CDN in the HTML file.
(4) Use d3.json()to read samples.json into the script.
(5) Print a simple message to browser console. (Optional?)
(6) Run 
    python -m http.server 
    and open browser to the port address (likely 8000).
(7) 

read and parse the actual data. Modify the code to change the printed console message from a simple "hello" to the entire dataset:


TYPE THIS CODE INTO THE WEB BROWSER CONSOLE TO PARSE:

      d3.json("samples.json").then(function(data){
          console.log(data);
      });


Upon parsing:
      The data is structured as an object that contains three keys at the top level:
      *Each of these keys is associated with an array that contains 153 elements.* 
        (a) metadata array:
            The metadata array contains objects
            (each of which contains details of a volunteer)
              such as: (1) age
                       (2) location
                       (3) ethnicity
                       (4) ID number
                       (5) and weekly washing frequency of the belly button
        (b) names array:
            the names array contains ID numbers of the volunteers
            (even though this information is [already] included in the metadata array)
            
              *The names array may be useful in rapidly 
              retrieving an ID number when creating a plot.*

        (c) samples
        |
        |===> *Check out the samples array and inspect the first element.*
          
              The samples array's first element is an object, with four key-value pairs:
                (1) the id key identifies the ID number
                (2) The otu_ids property is an array of the ID numbers 
                    of all the bacteria found in this person's navel:
                        (a) OTU stands for Operational Taxonomic Unit
                            (meaning the species/bacterial type)
                        (b) *there are 80 bacterial types with distinct ID numbers*
                (3) The sample_values array contains the corresponding species name 
                    for each bacterial ID number.
                (4) Some bacterial species have different ID numbers, 
                    *but are clumped together under the same otu_label.*

  
  *The final visualization of the data will consist of a drop-down menu,
  which allows the user to select an individual via ID number;
  once the ID number is selected, demographic information
  of the selected individual will be displayed.

  Each individual is represented by an object, which means access to both
  keys and values insidew an object is needed for the visualization.*
  |
  |===> (1) The Object.entries() method allows access to both an object's keys and values. 
        It returns each key-value pair as an array.
        |
        |===> Example:
          
              Q: You are given the following object. 
                 Use Object.entries() to print each key-value pair inside an array.

                    researcher1 = {
                        name: 'Roza',
                        age: 34,
                        hobby: 'Hiking'
                    };

              A: console.log(Object.entries(researcher1));
        
        (2) The forEach() method allows access to each element of an array.
        |
        |===> Example: 
        
              Q: Use the forEach() method to print to the console each trait and 
                 corresponding property?

              researcher1 = [['name', 'Roza'], ['age', 34], ['hobby','Hiking']];

                    name Roza
                    age 34
                    hobby Hiking
                
              A: the forEach() method iterates through each element in an array. 
                 In this case, there are smaller arrays, each including two elements, 
                 inside an outer array. 
              
                To access these elements, the argument ([first, second]) is used, 
                where first and second are arbitrarily chosen for convenience. 
                *They could have been named ([x, y]) or ([key, value]).*

              researcher1.forEach(([first, second]) => console.log(first + ": " + second));

  TYPE THIS CODE IN THE WEB BROWSER CONSOLE TO PARSE:
  
      d3.json("samples.json").then(function(data){
          firstPerson = data.metadata[0];
          Object.entries(firstPerson).forEach(([key, value]) =>
            {console.log(key + ': ' + value);});
      });

  (HOW THE CODE WORKS)

        d3.json("samples.json").then(function(data){

          firstPerson = data.metadata[0];
          ===>metadata[0]--extracting the metadata of the first person in the dataset

          Object.entries(firstPerson).forEach(([key, value]) =>
          ===>Object.entries--the Object.entries() method returns each key-value pair in an array
          ===>the forEach() method accesses each element of these pairs

            {console.log(key + ': ' + value);});

      });
  
  Upon parsing: [everything being displayed correclty]
                [reminder: the end objective is to display the information in a dropdown menu]
